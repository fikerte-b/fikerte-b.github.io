    <h1>My Background</h1>
    <p>
        This is Fikerte Benti. My undergraduate degree is from Ethiopia in Industrial Engineering. 
        After I came here in USA, I couldn’t find a job in my profession, so I ended up working in retail store as retail associate. 
        Since my day-to-day activities involve interacting with customers and employees, 
        this was the perfect opportunity for me to be familiar with USA’s culture, living style, technology and even language. 
        Even if I gained very valuable life lessons, I was always in a move for financial and professional growth.

        As I was exploring my options and taking some other classes, a friend recommended me to look into Maharishi International University.
        After careful consideration, I have decided to apply for the extended master’s degree program in software development.
        I would like to start my own bisuness and came up with some idea. Here below is the link.
